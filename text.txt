Neural Machine Translation model
The Translation API's recognition engine supports a wide variety of languages for the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model.

These languages are specified within a recognition request using language code parameters as noted on this page. Most language code parameters conform to ISO-639 identifiers, except where noted.

Translations from any language to any language in this list are supported. Romanization and transliteration are supported only on the Cloud Translation - Advanced API. The list is updated as new languages are added. You can also list the supported languages by using Cloud Translation - Basic or Cloud Translation - Advanced APIs.
